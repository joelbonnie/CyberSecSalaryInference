Cyber Security is a fast growing and essential sector of the Information Technology industry. It deals with securing computer based systems and networks, and resolving the increasing threats to private companies and government institutions.

In this project we aim to analyze a sample of salaries for cyber security professionals by determining whether there was a general difference in the salaries received by professionals in 2021 and 2022 (i.e., during the COVID 19 pandemic). The explanatory variable and response variable in our project would be the work year and the salary. Thus, using the mean salary for the location parameter and the standard deviation for the scale parameter is appropriate to compare salaries between years.

Our dataset, obtained from Infosec-Jobs, was created through a survey collecting salaries of cybersecurity and infosec professionals. The variables in the dataset we would be interested in are the work_year and salary_in_usd variable. The former corresponds to the work year and the latter corresponds to the gross salary of a given worker (converted to USD).

According to a study done by Lallie et. al. - ‘The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks’. The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in many institutions switching most of their operations to an online medium. Muthuppalaniappan and Stevenson stated that healthcare organizations and universities are now also facing heightened cyber-security threats in the midst of the pandemic.

We wish to hypothesize whether this tremendous increase in cyber warfare from the onset of the pandemic has had a statistically significant impact on cybersecurity salaries.
